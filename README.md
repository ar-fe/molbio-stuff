## [Insert a pattern / restriction enzyme recognition site into a coding sequence](cds-pattern/)
Allows to insert one or several nucleotide sequences into a coding sequence of a protein while preserving the translation.

Degenerate patterns in [IUPAC nomenclature](https://www.bioinformatics.org/sms/iupac.html) are supported.

If a protein sequence is input, it will be back-translated according to the standard genetic code using the most frequent codon in human.
